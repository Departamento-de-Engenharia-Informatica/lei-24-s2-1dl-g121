# Supplementary Specification (FURPS+)

## Functionality

_Specifies functionalities that:  
&nbsp; &nbsp; (i) are common across several US/UC;  
&nbsp; &nbsp; (ii) are not related to US/UC, namely: Audit, Reporting and Security._

(i) Register various types of things, like jobs, skills, etc;

(i) Assign things like skills to collaborators, skills to jobs, etc;

(ii)

|:----------------------|:--------------------------------------------|
| **Auditing**          | Provide audit trails of system execution.   |
| **Reporting**         | Provide reporting facilities.               |
| **Security**          | Provide services to protect access to certain resources or information.       |


## Usability

_Evaluates the user interface. It has several subcategories,
among them: error prevention; interface aesthetics and design; help and
documentation; consistency and standards._

At the moment, we do not have the information needed to describe this.
## Reliability

_Refers to the integrity, compliance and interoperability of the software. The requirements to be considered are: frequency and severity of failure, possibility of recovery, possibility of prediction, accuracy, average time between failures._

At the moment, we do not have the information needed to describe this.

## Performance

_Evaluates the performance requirements of the software, namely: response time, start-up time, recovery time, memory consumption, CPU usage, load capacity and application availability._

At the moment, we do not have the information needed to describe this.

## Supportability

_The supportability requirements gathers several characteristics, such as:
testability, adaptability, maintainability, compatibility,
configurability, installability, scalability and more._

At the moment, we do not have the information needed to describe this.

### Design Constraints

_Specifies or constraints the system design process. Examples may include: programming languages, software process, mandatory standards/patterns, use of development tools, class library, etc._

For now, our group has been using Java, PlantUML and JavaFX.
### Implementation Constraints

_Specifies or constraints the code or construction of a system 
such as: mandatory standards/patterns, implementation languages,
database integrity, resource limits, operating system._

At the moment, we do not have the information needed to describe this.

### Interface Constraints

_Specifies or constraints the features inherent to the interaction of the
system being developed with other external systems._

At the moment, we do not have the information needed to describe this.

### Physical Constraints

_Specifies a limitation or physical requirement regarding the hardware used to house the system, as for example: material, shape, size or weight._

At the moment, we do not have the information needed to describe this.
