## Introduction

Purpose and Scope

The purpose of this document is to provide the reader with information
on the application being developed for "MusgoSublime" to facilitate the 
maintenance of green spaces. Below you will find various sections, such as 
System Overview, System Features, System Requirements, Troubleshooting and 
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ).

## System Overview

The  program is a unified software solution designed
to streamline the management of green space organizations.
Its objective is to help the staff organize and simplify their work, that includes optimizing resource
allocation based on skills and availability, ensuring timely vehicle maintenance, enhancing
collaboration among team members, and improving overall productivity and efficiency. Structured
hierarchically, the program consists of interconnected modules such as Skills Management,
Collaborator Management, Job Management, Vehicle Registration, Maintenance Scheduling, and more.

## System Features
Not all users have access to all features. The features are divided into two main categories: HRM and FM.

### HRM
- Add skills to the program and assign them to a Collaborator
- Add jobs to the program
- Register Collaborators to the program
- Ask the program to generate a team proposal for a task based on the skills necessary to do it

### FM
- Register vehicles to the program
- Assign when a certain vehicle should be checked up
- Get a list generated by the program with the vehicles that need to go to check-up

### GSM
- Calculate the exact costs referring to water consumption of specific green space
- Create a pie chart to know which piece(s) of equipment is/are used in each day to
  understand the users’ preferences
- Collect data from the user portal
  about the use of the park, to understand the use of the park
  by different age groups
- Import a .csv file containing lines with:
  "Water Point X, Water Point Y, Distance"
  into a unique data structure
-  Apply an algorithm that returns the routes
   to be opened and pipes needed to be laid with a minimum accumulated
   cost

### QAM
- Run tests for inputs of variable size, to
  observe the asymptotic behavior of the execution time of the US13
  algorithm
